"The whole flow of the movement was irregular at the beginning of the performance. The distance from the line was high, in some places this error from the reference line was inward and sometimes it was outwards. In the second part of the movement, the conditions were better and almost normal. Overall not a significant performance.",0,P1-T1-S1
"In this section, the first part of the movement deviated more from the reference path, but it was towards the outside. In the second part, the movement was more regular, but there was an error towards the inside. Capturing the space bar has been good at times other than the start of movement.",1,P1-T1-S2
"In the first part of the movement, the conditions were better. The space bar is hit on time. In the second part, it deviates outward. There is some limitation observed in the end regarding their movement.",1,P1-T1-S3
"In this part, it can be seen that the movement is completely irregular and the speed of the movement was not high enough, and the error was high, and the conditions were unstable. It was not good except for taking the space bar.",0,P1-T1-S4
"In this part, at first, the speed was good and the movement was almost in line with the desired trajectory, and it was good to activate the space bar. There was an error in the second part, both outward and inward, and the space bar was taken on time.",1,P1-T1-S5
"The accuracy, meaning the distance from the line, is low and the mouse pointer has gone to the inside and activating the space bar is also with a pause. They lost their concentration while hitting the space bar and deviated from the dashed line. The planning of the movement was also poor because there were long pauses in the corners. Hand tremors are also high. He was also weak in planning the line and concentrated in the corners and the hand tremors were high.",0,P1-T2-S1
"In this part, there was a lot of vibration and it went too much into the geometry and they made a mistake in hitting the space bar in the corners and therefore, did not take the space bar in time. The movement in the corners was again with a lot of stops.",0,P1-T2-S2
"The hand tremor is too much and the focus is too low when hitting the space bar to the point that the mouse pointer falls completely out of the trajectory. When hitting the space bar, the speed is either too high or too slow. The movement in the corners is not sharp enough. The error of the distance from the line has happened more towards the inside.",0,P1-T2-S3
"In this part, during the movement, the distance error was from the line to the inside, and there was a lot of pause in the timing of the space bar and angle change. The speed and accuracy have improved a little, but most of the distance from the lines is towards the inside and the corners are not completely sharp.",0,P1-T2-S4
"In this performance, it has tended to move inwards and the mouse pointer vibrated sometimes. They hit the space bar more accurately but it still lags a little. The speed of movement is uniform. Passing the corner is done carefully.",1,P1-T2-S5
"The space bar task is completely forgotten in the beginning but they remembered it suddenly towards the end. The mouse pointer goes out of the trajectory at the beginning. The sharpness of the corner is not observed. Towards the ends the mouse pointer has invaded the star geoometry. In the continuation of the straight path, they reached the end of the path with pressing space bar.",0,P1-T3-S1
"The hand tremors and the movement fluctuates around the trajectory, and it goes both inside and outside of the star geometry. They have not moved in the right direction. The corners are not sharp.",0,P1-T3-S2
"This was better than the previous trial. But still, The mouse pointer has not moved on the dashed line and has moved away from the line. There is no sharpness in the corners. It fluctuates, which may be due to fatigue. At the end of the track, the space bar is pressed and the corner is sharp, but it fluctuates a bit.",1,P1-T3-S3
The start was not good and the hand was shaky and entered the star geometry and then the balance of movement was regained. They didn't handle the space bar correctly and They also passed the corner in a weired manner.,0,P1-T3-S4
"In this part, The movement is close to the dashed line, but again it is not exact. They did not pay attention to the sharpness in the corner and continued the fluctuating movement. The space bar was also hit correctly.",1,P1-T3-S5
"At the starting point of the movement, the planning of the movement was poor. Then, when starting from zero flag, They released the space bar late and their hand was shaky while pressing the space bar. It has an inward deviation from the dashed line. The accuracy is not good. Before reaching point 1, it has already entered the star geometry. They also forgot to press the space bar towards the end.",0,P1-T4-S1
"The distance from the line is very large and not good at all. The deviation is inward. The speed is very high, but the accuracy is not good at all. They took the space on time, but then they did not act well in releasing the space bar.",0,P1-T4-S2
"The beginning of the path has improved in terms of accuracy, but it still deviates inward, and in the second part of the path, the accuracy has decreased a lot, and at the end of the path, the space button has not been handled well. The corners are not sharp.",0,P1-T4-S3
"In terms of accuracy, speed, and timing of hitting the space bar, it has improved a lot, and hand tremors have decreased. Deviation from the line is still there, but it is much better than before.",1,P1-T4-S4
"It has worsened slightly in terms of distance from the line, it has deviated to the inside, and it has also developed hand tremors.",0,P1-T4-S5
"The participant handles the space bar well and the distances from the corners are correct. It has some inward deviation from the main path which is not good. In general, the uniformity and speed of movement is desirable.",1,P1-T5-S1
"In the second part, they continued the error inward and tried to correct it, but they passed all the way inside the star geometry, which is not good. When pressing the space bar, they lost their focus and the trajectory they took is out of its normal state.",0,P1-T5-S2
"In the third part, the trend continues and we have a deviation towards the inside, and the tremors of the hand have increased, and the uniformity of the movement has disappeared, and the performance has improved a bit in the corner, but the performance is still not good.",0,P1-T5-S3
"In the fourth part, we have a back-and-forth movement in and outwards, and there are problems in handling the space bar, the space bar is not taken in time, and its distance from the corner is not as it should be. The participant here is not focused enough.",0,P1-T5-S4
"We still have an error towards the inside and the space bar handling is good in terms of distance from the corners, but the focus is lost during the space bar handling.",0,P1-T5-S5
"At first we see the uniformity of the movement. The speed is good, the space bar handling is good. In the second part, there was an irregularity and the space bar handling was impropper, and the sharpness of the corners was not considered and the whole trajectory was not crossed evenly.",1,P2-T1-S1
"In the first part, the movement is better and the second part is disoriented. The sharpness in the corners is not in very good condition. The distance from the line has been inward, which is not good.",0,P2-T1-S2
"In this part, they did not plan the movement correctly, at the beginning of the movement, the error was inward, and in the second part, the conditions were worse, and only the general form was preserved and did not perform up to a desirable level.",0,P2-T1-S3
"In this subtrial, in the first part, the speed of the movement was good,but the distance from the line inwards was large. The alignment is correct, but still there is a big error. Taking the space bar and moving past the corners has been good.",0,P2-T1-S4
"In the final part, the movement has been consistent, except for one part that has moved inwards.",1,P2-T1-S5
"The movement starts with a hit on the space bar, which is not correct. Speed and accuracy have improved, and there are fewer errors. Hand tremors can be observed at the corners, and precision is lacking. The space bar was pressed prematurely.",0,P2-T2-S1
"The mouse pointer is vibrating. They followed the corners more closely, but they pressed the space bar too early. They experienced hand tremors while using the Space bar.",0,P2-T2-S2
"Once again, the timing of the Space bar is not consistent, and it was pressed for too long. Hand tremors are evident. The inward movement is reduced. Concentration in the corners is lacking, and it deviated from the path.",0,P2-T2-S3
"It wasn't sharp enough while navigating the corners, and their hand was shaking. The distance from the line was toward the outside, and at the end of the path, the space bar was pressed prematurely.",0,P2-T2-S4
"The overall movement has been good, but the movement speed is high, leading to hand tremors. There are fluctuations during Space bar usage.",1,P2-T2-S5
"In the beginning, the space bar is pressed too early. It's off to a good start, and the dotted line following has improved. The movement around the corner is not very sharp, but it was not bad. They took spaces both early and left them late. The corners have been well traveled.",1,P2-T3-S1
"It has been good in the beginning and has been almost in line with the dotted line. The corner is slightly curved. After that, the hand was shaking a little. Space is taken early again. The corner is well traveled.",1,P2-T3-S2
"In this section, They followed the dotted line closely. It is curved in the corner. It's a little bit like they has lost their concentration and they moved out of line. Space bar pressing has been correct at the start of the corner vicinity, but they have let go late.",0,P2-T3-S3
"It has a good start and acceptable sharp corners. It continues to vibrate but its outside of the star geometry. They caught the space correctly, but the release was not done correctly. They released the space late.",1,P2-T3-S4
This time the mouse pointer has gone on the dashed line and has respected the sharpness of the corner well. The pressing of space bar has been done a little bit ahead of time.,2,P2-T3-S5
"At the starting point, the motion planning was poor, and they pressed the space bar in a position where they should not have pressed it. In the middle corner, they did not maintain the proper speed for the trajectory near the corner, and they deviated from the route in a circular manner at the end of the path. They pressed the space bar earlier than necessary. However, the overall performance is relatively good in terms of accuracy, and there are minimal hand tremors.",1,P2-T4-S1
"In this section there are deviations from the dotted line, but it is towards the outside. Again, at the end of the path, he pressed the space bar too early.",1,P2-T4-S2
"In the section between corners 2 and 3, deviations from the reference dashed line are inward, which is more problematic. At the end of the path, they pressed the space bar sooner than required and released it later. However, the sharpness of the corners is satisfactory in the middle and at the end. The trajectory taken overall is decent.",1,P2-T4-S3
"The spaces at the beginning and end of the track were not triggered on time, and there is a noticeable deviation from the line, which occurred toward the inside of the star area. Nevertheless, the speed of movement is commendable.",1,P2-T4-S4
"In the area between corners 4 and 0, unfortunately, they delayed pressing the space bar too long, and there is a deviation from the main route toward the inside. However, the speed around the middle corner of the route has been observed, and the overall movement speed is also high.",0,P2-T4-S5
"The participant did not hit the space in the right place at the beginning of the movement and left it too late, keeping the space almost halfway. It is good in terms of speed and uniformity, but the sharpness of the corners is lacking. In the second corner, handling the space bar was good and did not disturb the participant's concentration.",1,P2-T5-S1
"In this part, the error is a bit more pronounced than before, and it is inward, which is concerning. The time between holding and releasing Space is longer than it should be. The speed of movement is reasonable.",0,P2-T5-S2
"In the third part, the movement is relatively smoother and more uniform, yet we still observe deviation inward. Space is not triggered in the right place, and it is excessive during the space bar holding.",0,P2-T5-S3
"The speed and uniformity of the movement are relatively good, but we see an inward deviation, and the space bar handling is not consistent.",1,P2-T5-S4
"In this last part, the participant demonstrated good uniformity and speed, but did not press the space bar in time and did not release it promptly.",1,P2-T5-S5
"In this part, there is accuracy, and the speed is appropriate. Space bar pressing was good, and the sharpness around the corners are suitable, except for two minor points; the rest of the performance were very good.",2,P3-T1-S1
"They have uniformity of movement. Coordination of movement in the first part is appropriate. In the second part, they move out of the corner, and the movement is not desirable around these areas. In the second part, there was an inward deviation, which is considered an error.",1,P3-T1-S2
"In this part, the space bar has been mistakenly pressed in the middle of the movement because it was not pressed at the beginning of the movement. The movement planning was good. In the beginning, the error was more, but it has improved along the way.",1,P3-T1-S3
"We observe that the conditions have improved; they made an error in the second part of the movement that deviated to the inside. Sharpness in corners is acceptable, and speed is good.",1,P3-T1-S4
"In this part, the speed of movement is good. In the beginning, it is alright, but in the second part, it has deviated a little bit inwards. Space bar handling is appropriate and done on time.",2,P3-T1-S5
"While pressing the space bar, the hand was shaking, but the movement was uniform, and there was no deviation from the line. The sharpness around the corners was observed, but again, when pressing the space bar, they lost their concentration while changing the direction.",1,P3-T2-S1
"The hand tremor has been observed, and there was an error when pressing the space bar. Before pressing the space bar, there was a deviation from the line to the inside. Pressing the space bar has been associated with hand tremors.",0,P3-T2-S2
"Hand tremors have become much less, and the error has only occurred in one part as a deviation from the line to the inside. In the corner, the path is better traveled. When pressing the space, the concentration was better, and the speed was uniform and good. But the corner while pressing the space bar.",1,P3-T2-S3
"They have tremors. The deviation from the line has occurred inward. We don't see enough sharpness in the corner. Space bar has been hit on time, and they have not had hand tremors towards the end.",1,P3-T2-S4
"In the first part, the movement creeps outward, and in the second part inward very little. Accuracy in corner sharpness has been good. space bar is pressed early. The uniformity and accuracy of movement have been good.",2,P3-T2-S5
"It has started well. First, Their hand is shaking. Sharpness in the corner is not observed. The accuracy of the movement on the line is good and they took the space bar on time. But the space bar was released late.",1,P3-T3-S1
"It has started well and has been on the line, the sharpness of the middle part has been observed. They also caught the space bar on time, but at the end of the track, their hand was a little shaky and the corner was not well covered, and they released the space bar a little bit late.",2,P3-T3-S2
"The hand tremor was observed, but the movement was well aligned with the path, they took the space bar on time, but the release of the space bar was done late.",1,P3-T3-S3
"The start is good, but there is a distance error from the line to the inside. In the middle part of the route, the sharpness is observed. The space bar is taken in time at the end of the track. But again, the release of the space bar has been delayed.",1,P3-T3-S4
It started well and handled the corners well. The space bar has also been taken on time,2,P3-T3-S5
"They pressed the space bars on time and the movement in the first part of the track is good and acceptable in terms of accuracy, and the second part has a dangerous error towards the inside of the star geometry. At the end of the track, he took the space bar on time and it was good in terms of the sharpness of the corners.",1,P3-T4-S1
"In the interval from corner 1 to 2, in the first part of the movement, it deviated from the dashed line, but it was outside the star geometry, they pressed the space bar in time, but before that, the mouse pointer entered inside the star, which is a dangerous area. The sharpness of the corners is also good.",1,P3-T4-S2
"In this part, they took the space bar on time, but it deviated from the path and is also towards the inside. In the second part, the motion error  has reduced, but the tremor is still there. The space bar pressing is also late at the end of the route.",1,P3-T4-S3
"In the next interval, They caught the space bar on time, but their hand was shaking and both cases were deviations from the main path towards the inside of the star. The speed is good. The part at the end of the track is spaced on time and it is also favorable in terms of the sharpness around the corners.",1,P3-T4-S4
"They have pressed and released the space bar in time and the hand tremors are much less. It has deviated a little to the inside, but along the way, it has maintained the uniformity of the movement and has also handled the space bars properly.",2,P3-T4-S5
"The participant performed very well in this section and holding and releasing the space was almost appropriate, we have a little error towards the inside, which is very little. The sharpness of the corners is not prefect. Speed and uniformity are also suitable.",2,P3-T5-S1
"Some distance from the line, but it is towards the outside. Space bar is hit in good time. A little later, the space bar was released on time, and the speed of the movement was good, and the dexterity and uniformity were good.",2,P3-T5-S2
"The movement is very smooth and good. We have a little error to the outside and a little to the inside, but the error to the inside is more worrisome, and when holding the space bar, the focus is lost and the mouse pointer deviated from the path, and overall the performance is not bad.",1,P3-T5-S3
"In this part, we have some fluctuations around the line that should be followed, which is sometimes inward and sometimes outward, and overall the error is within an acceptable range, and they hit the space on time.",2,P3-T5-S4
"The task is well done, uniformity and speed are good. The sharpness of the movement around corners is good. The space bar was taken a bit earlier than it should, but overall it can be said that it was a good move.",2,P3-T5-S5
"Movement  flowis appropriate in this area, and movement in the corners is also appropriate. In the second part, a slight deviation can be seen inwards. In the last corner, the movement has been relatively good, but fluctuations are observed.",1,P4-T1-S1
"In this section, there is a lot of error at the beginning of the movement, and then it gets better. There are deviations in the whole route. The speed is good, but the error increases over time.",1,P4-T1-S2
"Here at first the movement is good, and there is little fluctuations in the movement. In the next part, the mouse pointer has deviated inwards. The movement in the corners was normal. Compared to the previous subtrial, the error has decreased.",1,P4-T1-S3
"The conditions were similar to the previous one, but the deviation from the main line was high. Vertical movements have more error than horizontal ones. Taking space is also done with a lot of errors in this part. The speed of movement remains constant.",0,P4-T1-S4
"The downward movement is better done without error, but the rightward movement is done with more inward error. Probably, because it is nearing the end, hitting the space bar has was not good in the end.",1,P4-T1-S5
"Here, the start of their movement was accompanied by tremors, and along the way, there was a lot of hand tremors, but the distance from the line was not large. When moving from the corners, they are curved and not sharp enough. During the task, they released the space bar by mistake and took the space again, which was an error.",1,P4-T2-S1
Here the hand tremor is inward and not sharp in the corner. They lose their concentration while holding the space bar and this causes the mouse to tremor. But they were not careful in the movement in the corners and stopped and the movement was not uniform enough. The shaking of the hand has also been inward.,0,P4-T2-S2
"The hand tremor is still inward. In the movement of the corners, the high speed has made it not sharp enough. The space bar pressing is done late. They lost focus while handling the space bar and hand tremors was the result. When turning in the corners, the stop is long and they have left the space bar too late.",0,P4-T2-S3
"The movement speed has become more uniform and the fluctuations has decreased, and hitting the space bar has been done with more concentration, but still they do not have enough sharpness in passing the corners.",1,P4-T2-S4
"In the last part, hand tremor is less, but the speed of movement has been reduced to increase concentration. Again, the corners are not sharp enough and they did not release the space bar in time. But hand tremors have decreased relatively.",1,P4-T2-S5
"They started well here and hit the space bar on time but released it late. the errors are toward outside of the star region. The accuracy of movement on the reference line is good. In the begining, the corners of the star are not passed sharp enough. Few fluctuations are observed. He pressed and released the space bar at the end of the route in time. The corner is properly crossed.",2,P4-T3-S1
"The movement starts with a low vibration and the mouse pointer enters the star region a little. It has left the star geometry later. The corner is not passed sharp enough. Then, the mouse pointer travels almost on the dashed line. An inconsistency was observed traveling through the corners.",1,P4-T3-S2
"The speed was very good, but the start was shaky. The mouse pointer has left the star. Tryed tried to get back on the lines. The middle corner is not travelled sharp enough. They pressed the space bar in time. They turned atound the corner a little inappropriately, but their hand trembled while pressing the space bar at the end.",1,P4-T3-S3
"In the beginning the movement was shaky. The mouse pointer entered the star geometry a little here. The middle corner is not sharp and is rounded. The movement was done close to the dotted line, but it moved inside the star geometry a little. He pressed and released the space bar in time. But it has gone through the corner badly and does not have proper sharpness at all.",0,P4-T3-S4
"In the beginning the movement was on the dashed line, but then it went toward outside of the star geometry. The corner is almost traveled correctly, but not on the dotted line. In the continuation, They had hand tremors, but they pressed the space bar and finished the end of the trajectory well.",1,P4-T3-S5
"At the beginning of the task, they released the space bar a little late, but it was good in terms of distance from the line and accuracy of movement. At the end of the path, they handled the space bar in time. The sharpness around the corners is observed. Smoothness of movement is good.",2,P4-T4-S1
"The accuracy of the trajectory is good, but it is worse than before. They pressed and released the spaces on time. But it has a shaking hand and has deviated inwards.",1,P4-T4-S2
"The space bar is released late in the first part of the route. The hand was shaking, but it was not severe, and at the end of the path, They pressed the space bar in time. But the sharpness around the corners has not been observed.",1,P4-T4-S3
"In terms of hitting the space bar on time, it is good and there is a hand tremor and the mouse pointer somtimes deviates inwards, which is negligible because it was a mild intrusion. It is good in terms of accuracy, and the uniformity of movement and speed are also good.",2,P4-T4-S4
"The space bar at the beginning of the track is released late and it is good in terms of accuracy, but it does not respect the speed in the middle of the track and it deviates to the inside, away from the line. The space bar caught the end in time but left it too late.",1,P4-T4-S5
"They pressed the space bar on time but released it too late. At the end of the movement, they forgot the half interval that he was obliged to hold the space bar. Uniformity and speed are almost suitable and we don't have many errors, but working with the space bar has not been good at all.",1,P4-T5-S1
"The error has increased and the uniformity and speed have been good. At the time of hitting the space bar, the focus is reduced and the deviation has happened inward, which is dangerous.",0,P4-T5-S2
"The movement is uniform and good, but we have an error towards the inside. It's dangerous. The space bar was pressed on time but released late. Overall, the participant had a good speed.",1,P4-T5-S3
"Due to the high speed, the participant passed the corner quickly, and the sharpness of the corner was not preserved, and the speed of the movement was also appropriate.",1,P4-T5-S4
"They had a good speed and was very accurate in relation to their speed, and their hand did not shake and they did the space bar handling well.",2,P4-T5-S5
It was a very bad movement and there were many deviations  from the reference line and most of them were toward inside the star geometry. Movement planning in this section has been very weak.,0,P5-T1-S1
"In the second part, there were many deviations and the error was towards the inside and was very weak. No matching segment can be found between the real trajectory and the dashed line.",0,P5-T1-S2
"In this part, the situation has improved, but the movement is still wrong. The space bar handling is alright. Again, They have unacceptable errors in 70% of the path.",0,P5-T1-S3
"The movement speed was good and the movement in the corners was good, but the movement towards the inside was too much, it has improved from the stage.",0,P5-T1-S4
"At the beginning of the movement, the errors were inward, but the space bar handling was correct. At the end of the movement, the movement error is less, but the space is pressed for too late. It shows that the focus was on the movement on the dashed line and not handling the space bar.",0,P5-T1-S5
"There are hand tremors inwards, especially when changing directions, releasing the space bar was done late and pressing it was early on the other hand. In the corner, they would leave the space bar and take it again. The movement around the corner was not done with alignment to the dashed line and the error was towards the inside of the star geometry.",0,P5-T2-S1
The whole path has been covered with the space bar. Hand tremors were high and inward. The space bar was taken earlier than it should have been. Abandoning the space bar is too late. The strong shaking of the hand was inward. The movement was done at high speed.,0,P5-T2-S2
"Hand tremors were too much and toward inside the star geometry. High movement speed was observed. Pressing and releasing the space bar was not timely and it was not focused in the corners and the movement was not sharp enough around the corner, and the speed was not uniform and it increased and decreased during the task.",0,P5-T2-S3
"During the movement around the corners, The mouse pointer has completely deviated inward and the sharpness around the corners has not been observed, and there has been a long pause in changing the direction in places where the space bar has been held.",0,P5-T2-S4

"They pressed the space bar right on time but released it too late. The movement around the corner is curved and not sharp enough. There are some errors towards the inside of the star geometry.

Their speed was generally good, but they showed little accuracy.",0,P5-T3-S1
"Here it started with hand tremors and continued inside the star geometry and the movement around the corner is not sharp enough. The mouse pointer has gone back into the star geometry in this section. The hand tremor continued and they did not follow the dashed line and handle space bar in time, and did not go through the corner with a proper sharpness and did not release the space bar in time.",0,P5-T3-S2
"The beginning is better than before, but the movement in the mid section is not sharp enough. When pressing the space bar they deviated inwards and continued there. He didn't take the space bar on time. The corner is not sharp enough and he did not release the space bar in time and entered the star.",0,P5-T3-S3
They did not concentrate and entered the star. They did not cut the middle corner correctly and accurately. Continue on the dashed lines. They didn't press the space bar on time. They didn't move across the corner properly and didn't press the space bar in time and entered the star geometry while doing that.,0,P5-T3-S4
"They were not focused in this trial and moved inside the star far from the lines. Inside the star geometry again, They have not pressed the space bar on time and have reached the end of the path forgetting the space bar.",0,P5-T3-S5
"The start of the movement is good and slow but then the speed is good, but they hit the spaces bar late and released it late as well. In the following sections, They deviates from the line and the shaking of the hand is present in the entire path and the whole movement did not go smoothly.",0,P5-T4-S1
"The space bar is pressed early and released late, and the movement has deviated from the reference line to the inside, which is dangerous. The hand tremor is observed, but they have a good speed. The sharpness around the middle corner and the end corner has not been observed well.",0,P5-T4-S2
"At first, The mouse pointer is not following the reference line, but it is towards the outside and is less dangerous. They pressed the space bar in the middle of the path where they shouldn't have. In the following, they dangerously deviated from the line, and they hit the space bar in time, but the sharpness around the end corner was not good enough. The space bar is not held continuously and the uniformity of movement is not desirable.",0,P5-T4-S3
"They released the space bar late, we and didn't observe the sharpness in the middle corner, but they did well in terms of hand tremor. They pressed the space bar early at the end point, they did not have consistency in handling the space bar.",0,P5-T4-S4
"The space bar was not pressed and released on time both at the beginning and at the end. The hand tremor has increased and the movement has deviated from the line sometimes inwards and sometimes outwards. In terms of accuracy and smoothness, it is not too bad and not too good.",0,P5-T4-S5
"They have worked very poorly in terms of planning. They couldn't start on the track, they pressed the space bar early and released it late, and they have had deviations towards the inside. The movement is not uniform and at a constant speed.",0,P5-T5-S1
We have some inward deflection and some hand tremors. The space bar was pressed early and released late. Overall not very satisfactory.,0,P5-T5-S2
"The movement is sometimes very fast and sometimes slow, which shows the lack of uniformity. The deviation is inward. At the time of pressing the space bar, the focus has decreased and they have completely moved inside the star, which is not acceptable.",0,P5-T5-S3
"There is almost no positive points. No speed, no uniformity, and we have an inward deviation, and the space bar is not pressed in time. The space bar is presssed ahead of time and they moved inside the star geometry. The space bar has also been released late.",0,P5-T5-S4
"In the final part, the planning is still not good and the space bar is not released on time. We have an inward deviation. The movement around the corners are not sharp enough.",0,P5-T5-S5
"The performance in the first part was good, but there was an error towards the inside. In the continuation of the movement, the conditions were better. In the following, the error was smaller and the distance from the line were toward outside, and the space bar handling was good and sharpness around the corner was acceptable.",1,P6-T1-S1
"Handling the space bar needs to be focused on more. There were many errors. We have had a serious error in the middle, and the performance in this part has been poor.",0,P6-T1-S2
"They made a mistake at the beginning of the movement, and it was towards the inside. In the second part, the error  was smaller and towards the outside. The speed of movement is very high. The trajectory has fluctuations around the corners, but pressing space bar was very timely and good.",1,P6-T1-S3
"It has continued well in the first part. But in the second part, it was accompanied by errors in movement and handling the space bar, and it can almost be said that it was an average performance.",1,P6-T1-S4
"In the final part, the movement was good and there were few mistakes, and in the second part, there were deviations towards the outside and inside, but it was minor and little. Space bar handling was done in a timely manner. In this section,They could not follow the dotted line well, but the rest of the movement was good.",1,P6-T1-S5
"First, they pressed the space bar on time, but their hand trembled first outward and then inward. The movement around the corners was curved and not sharp enough. The speed of performing the task has been high. They pressed the space bar in time in the first part, but released it late in the end.",1,P6-T2-S1
"The hand tremor was more outward. Traveling around the corner was good, and acceleration was moderate. They had a lot of pauses in corner 2 and pressed space bar early and released it late.",1,P6-T2-S2
"In the third part, there was no hand tremor in the first part, but in the second part of this section, there were some fluctuations and deviation toward outside. The participant's focus when pressing the space bar was reduced, and they had a lot of pause at point  3, and they released the space bar too late.",1,P6-T2-S3
"The hand tremor has decreased, and the accuracy around the corner has increased, and the movement has enough sharpness there, and the speed has decreased, and they have pressed the space bar hastily, and in the corner, while pressing the space bar the accuracy has decreased, and there was a pause.",1,P6-T2-S4
"Hand tremors and error have been observed toward the outside and the movement was accompanied by good speed and sharpness around the corners, Pressing the space bar late and releasing it on time. The speed of them performing the task was lower than average.",1,P6-T2-S5
"They started correctly, and they pressed the space bar on time. They did not release the space bar until reaching the next corners which wasn't good. They have followed the dotted lines correctly. The sharpness of movement around the corners is suitable. But in the second part of the trajectory, there was some hand tremor and they moved away from the dashed line.",1,P6-T3-S1
"The beginning was accompanied by a small tremor of the hand, which resulted in error toward outside of the star geometry. The movement around the corner is curved and not sharp. they neither pressed nor released the space in time. They have travelled around the corners almost perfect.",1,P6-T3-S2
"They have started well and moved on the dotted line. The corner is not sharp enough. Thier hand was shaking, and they went outside of the star geometry. They pressed the space bar in time but didn't release in time. The end corner of the track is also sharp enough. In general, the speed has been good.",1,P6-T3-S3
"This trial was associated with hand tremors and leaving the star circumference. The movement has a sharp corner here, but it does not match the path. Then, the trajectory was somewhat matched on the doted line, but it was shaky and with errors. They did not press and release space bar in time. The corner has been covered almost well.",1,P6-T3-S4
"The trajectory taken and the reference path were not aligned, and the corner angles were not good. They pressed space in time but did not release it in time.",0,P6-T3-S5
"The movement planning is not good because at the very beginning of the movement, They were completely out of the referene path. For a while, it was completely out of the dotted line, and for a while it returned to the main path but went away again. The space bar is pressed late at the end of the track, and the accuracy of movement along the track is not good either. It has deviated from the line, but it is towards the outside.",0,P6-T4-S1
"At the beginning, They released the space bar late, and the mouse pointer is moving outside the dotted line again, but because it is outside the star geometry, it is among the lesser dangerous errors. At the end, they pressed the space bar too early, and the sharpness around the middle corner was not observed.",0,P6-T4-S2
"They pressed the space bar at the beginning and end of the track on time. The sharpness of the movement around the middle corner has not been observed. Inaccuracy can be seen in the beginning of the movement, but they deviates to the outside of the star geometry, and here the accuracy of their movement has improved, and their movement speed is also good.",1,P6-T4-S3
Here it is initially outside the dashed line and continues to deviate from the path inwards. This behavior is risky. The sharpness of the middle corner is not observed. He hit the space on time in the beginning but late at the end. It is not good in terms of accuracy and good in terms of speed.,1,P6-T4-S4
"Their path planning is good because it moves on the main path. They pressed the space bar late, but at the end, they pressed the space bar on time. Unfortunately, the sharpness around the middle corner has not been observed.",1,P6-T4-S5
"The movement planning is good, and space bar is pressed and released in time at the beginning of the movement. There is a lot of deviation outwards. It shows that the participant was mot in a hurry and acted conservatively, which made them not come inside. We don't have enough sharpness around the corners, and at the end, they released the space bar too late.",1,P6-T5-S1
"In the second part of the movement, the performance is not bad. Space was taken early and left late, which can be ignored. We have a slight deviation that was towards the outside. The speed and uniformity of the movement are not bad, and overall the performance is relatively good.",1,P6-T5-S2
"The movement is a bit rushed, and the sharpness around the corner is not there. The speed and uniformity of the movement are suitable, and the space bar is pressed earlier and released later than it should. The participant's concentration during handling the space bar is not disturbed, but their high speed prevents them from following the path properly.",1,P6-T5-S3
"The uniformity of the movement is not appropriate in the beginning, and there is some error which is towards outside, and the space bar here is pressed and released late. We also see good sharpness around the corners.",1,P6-T5-S4
"The movement in the last part is hasty and careless, and the errors and deviations are outward, and the space bar is pressed almost inappropriately. The mouse poinnter has finally reached the end point in a good manner.",1,P6-T5-S5
"The movement is done at a slow speed since the participant was extra carefull, but there are deviations from the dashed line in the process. In the whole path, there is a constant error, pressing the space bar is almost in time, but again the deviation from the dashed line is high.",0,P7-T1-S1
"There are a lot of slight deviations and fluctuations during the task. The space bar is pressed on time, but the hand tremor while holding the space bar is high. The movement around the corners is not sharp enough. There are many deviations from the reference line in the end.",0,P7-T1-S2
"At the beginning of the movement, we have too much inward deviation from the reference line. In this section, both the speed and the deviation from the dashed line are getting better, and in the corners, handling the space bar and coordination while moving is good.",1,P7-T1-S3
"The movement has been done at a better speed, and the vibrations have reduced. There are two instances of error, and it was towards the inside, but it was minor.",1,P7-T1-S4
"In the last stage, the conditions were better than all the previous ones, both in terms of speed and direction. There were minor errors, and the space bar was handled on time.",2,P7-T1-S5
"The movement speed is low, and there is hand tremor, but it has not deviated from the main path significantly. At the end of the path, it deviates slightly inwards. The movement around the corners are not sharp enough. The space bar was pressed on time but released early. Their hand was shaking while holding the space.",1,P7-T2-S1
"The hand shakes a lot, but it didn't go off the line due to the low speed. In one part, it has deviated inwards. It is curved in the corner and does not have enough focus. It is not sharp enough. There has been a lot of pause in getting space.",1,P7-T2-S2
"They had tracking errors both inward and outward, and he was not focused around the corner. Their hand was shaking. They acted on time in pressing and releasing the space bar, but they did not focus enough while holding the space bar. There are a lot of pauses in the manuevers, and the movement around the corners is not sharp enough. The speed in the whole task is also low.",0,P7-T2-S3
"The speed of operation is low, but the accuracy has improved. Hand tremors have reduced except for movement around the corner which is inwards with error. Not enough sharpness is observed around the corner. The space bar pressed and released on time but they had a long pause while catching space during the move.",1,P7-T2-S4
"There was hand tremor in the last stage before pressing the space bar, there was an error towards the inside. In the corner, the performance is better, but it still deviates and does not have enough movement sharpness. They released the space bar late and lost their focus to finish the task.",1,P7-T2-S5
"The starting phase is done correctly, and they pressed and released the space bar in time. They moved almost perfectly on the dotted line, and the corner turns are done sharply. The speed is somewhat low.",1,P7-T3-S1
"The hand is shaking, one of the deviated lines has observed the sharpness of the corner. The hand shakes at the end of the track and hits and releases the space in time, and the end corner is also sharp. The speed is low.",2,P7-T3-S2
The movement started almost perfectly on the dotted line. There are some slight fluctuations. The turn around the middle corner is correctly. They pressed and released the space bar in time. The movement around the final corner is also sharp enough.,2,P7-T3-S3
"Here they started correctly. Then they showed hand tremor, and pressed and released the space in time. The movement around the corners is not sharp enough, and again shaky hands.",1,P7-T3-S4
"They had a good start almost on the reference line. The middle corner is not followed correctly, and the movement does not match the dashed line. Hand tremor in the next section, The space bar is pressed and released in time.",1,P7-T3-S5
"They show hand tremors throughout the entire task, and they handled the space bar on time. At the beginning and the end of the path there are fluctuations and deviations from the reference line. The main flaw is the uniformity of movement. The movement along the path has sudden stops.",1,P7-T4-S1
"They pressed the space bar on time. Hand tremors have decreased. The sharpness around the middle corner is not observed. It deviates from the path inwards, but not much. The uniformity of movement has also improved compared to the previous section, but it is still not good.",1,P7-T4-S2
"They deviated from the reference line. At first there is hand tremor. They deviated from the path towards the inside, and again, the bad uniformity of the movement and low speed are felt.",0,P7-T4-S3
"The beginning of the task is desirable in terms of space bar handling and trajectory smoothness. Here the trajectory following is not so good. In the second part, following the sharp corners was done better. In the middle section, they pressed the space bar by mistake. Hand tremors observed here. The uniformity of the route was not good.",1,P7-T4-S4
"In terms of space bar handling, they did good. In terms of the accuracy of the trajectory, it has improved a lot in this period. Again, the hand tremor can be observed, but there is not much deviation from the line. The movement is uniform.",2,P7-T4-S5
"The participant has long pauses and toneless movements. These pauses cause dangerous mistakes to the inside and the path is followed with fluctuations. The space bar is pressed and released on time, the distance from the dashed line is small and the movement planning is done well.",1,P7-T5-S1
"In the second part, the movement planning is not appropriate and it caused some intrusions into the star geometry in the corner. They could do well here. We still have inward deviation, and space bar is well pressed and released, they followed the corner section well.",1,P7-T5-S2
"In the third part, the movement is not uniform enough and we have a series of fluctuations that may be caused by fatigue. The space bar is pressed once in the middle of the path unnecessarily. There are some errors but not inwards, which is good. The vicinity of the corner was reached before pressing the space bar which is good. They are accurate both in pressing and releasing the space bar. Turning at the end of the task was not done skilfully.",1,P7-T5-S3
"The movement starts very well, but because the speed is too high, the control of the movement is lost and we have an inward deviation from the dashed line, and then we have fluctuations that are both inward and outward. The space bar was pressed at the right time, and when the space bar was held, their concentration was disturbed, the movement was very uncoordinated and with a lot of hand tremor.",1,P7-T5-S4
"The uniformity of movement is not very good, however, the accuracy of the reference tracking is acceptable and they moved almost well without error. Because the speed was kept low, the corner is sharp enough. The space was pressed but not released on time.",1,P7-T5-S5
"The uniformity of movement is good. At the beginning there are some very small deviations from the reference line inward but it was negligible, and the movement around the corners was good. We have also had some tremors in the second part of this section, which was towards the inside, but it was minor.",1,P8-T1-S1
"Their movement and speed are good. In the second part, we have errors and inward deviations. We don't have a sharp movement in the middle corner. At the end of the path that Space has kept, a deviant hole has happened to the inside. It has a good sharp corner at the end of the track.",1,P8-T1-S2
"At first, the movement was erratic, but the it changed into a uniform movement after a while. In the second part, the movement deviated from the reference line outwards. They have done good in terms of handling the space bar and sharpness of corners.",1,P8-T1-S3
"In this part, we can almost indicate that both speed and accuracy were good. The deviations were minimal. They had minor hand tremor. The sharpness around the corners are also well respected.",2,P8-T1-S4
"Compared to the previous stage, it was less accurate.",1,P8-T1-S5
"Handling the space bar have been on time. While pressing the space bar, the focus is reduced, but there is no major deviation from the line, and the corners have good sharpness.",2,P8-T2-S1
"The speed of operation is good, but there were some hand tremors, but it did not lead to large error. The movement in the corners has been improved. Again, hand tremors occurred while holding the space bar, but they did it in time.",1,P8-T2-S2
"In this part, the first hand tremor was observed, but there was no outward or inward deviation. There is not enough sharpness around the corner, and the speed of changing the angle in the corner is the cause of this problem. They had a pause in the corner, but the pressed and released the space bar on time.",1,P8-T2-S3
"The speed of which the task is done is good, but there is not enough sharpness in the corners. In the part where the space bar is held, the focus is reduced and it causes hand tremors. But pressing space has been done on time. Pauses while pressing the space bar have been reduced.",1,P8-T2-S4
"The speed of performing the task has improved, but they have slight hand tremors. We don't see a noticable error and they pressed and release space bar on time. There is not enough sharpness around the corner.",1,P8-T2-S5
They had a good start and pressed the space bar on time. The mouse pointer has moved almost on the reference line. The movement around the corner is sharp enough. The speed is low.,1,P8-T3-S1
"The movement speed is uniform. There are not much deviations from the reference line. Again, they have not deviated from the line. The corners are well travelled. The space bar has been pressed and released almost on time. Low speed and high accuracy are the main characteristics of this trial. ",1,P8-T3-S2
The mouse pointer moves on the dashed line. They seem to have hand tremor caused by exhaustion. In the corner the movement is slightly deviated towards the outside of the star geometery. The space bar is pressed in time but not released in time. The signs of fatigue is evident.,1,P8-T3-S3
"The beginning of the task is less accurate and the mouse pointer deviates towards the inside, but it is very close to the dashed line. The movement around the corner is sharp enough. They returned to the dashed line. They have continued their uniform movement and have pressed and released the space bar in time and have a sharp enough movement around the corner.",1,P8-T3-S4
"They continued monotonously. There are little vibrations in the trajectory. The mouse pointer moves on the dotted line and the space bar is hit on time, and the movement around the corners are sharp enough.",2,P8-T3-S5
"They handled the space bar on time and the accuracy of the trajectory was also good. They do not deviate from the reference line. The movement is not sharp in the middle corner, but it is sharp in the side corners.",2,P8-T4-S1
"All things considred the timing of the space bar is good and the hand tremor is mild. They deviate from the reference line inwards, which is not good.",1,P8-T4-S2
Well done in terms of space bar handling. The sharpness of movement around the middle and end corner is alright. Mild hand tremor is observed and the speed seems to be slow.,1,P8-T4-S3
"In terms of hand tremors, they have improved. The space bar handling is on time and there is not much deviation from the reference line. It would be better if the speed was higher.",1,P8-T4-S4
"They deviated from the reference path a little, but it is still acceptable, and the space bar is pressed on time, and the hand tremors are less compared to the previous parts.",2,P8-T4-S5
"The movement planning is very well done, and the space bar is pressed and released almost on time. The speed is a little slow, but it resulted in very good accuracy and uniformity and error-free trajectory. At the end of the movement, the space bar was pressed on time but released much earlier than it should. Sharpness around the corners is also suitable.",2,P8-T5-S1
"In the second part, the movement is almost uniform. It has been at a good speed, and we have had some deviations that outwards with conservatism. Due to the higher speed, we don't have a sharp corner, and the space bar is taken and released almost on time.",1,P8-T5-S2
"The task started at a good speed; however, we have a deviation from the reference line to the outside, which is a problem but not dangerous. The space is almost well handled. ",1,P8-T5-S3
"When pressing the space bar, they lost their focus and deviated from the main path. The uniformity of the movement is not good, and it has caused sudden movements to deviate inwards. The space bar is pressed on time, and the accuracy of the movement is not bad.",1,P8-T5-S4
"The accuracy in tracking the reference line is good, and the speed is not bad. Small parts of the movement are poorly executed in terms of uniformity of the movement, but in the end, they have pressed the space bar very well. They have finished the movement well. ",2,P8-T5-S5
"Movement speed is acceptable. In the beginning, the error of the movement was minimal. The space was pressed longer than it should have.

"At first, the movement flow was better, and then as the time passed, the error increased. The handling of the space bar and their timing and the sharpness of the movement around the corners have been improved.",1,P9-T1-S2
"In the third open subtrial, the first half of the task is done better than the second. In the second half, the mouse pointer had some errors outwards. Space bar handling has not been good. Generally speaking it was acceptable.",1,P9-T1-S3
"Here, first, the error and deviation from the reference line was inward, and in the second part, the deviation was outward and less. The speed of movement has been good. There is a long pause when pressing the space bar. The movement around the corners has been good.",1,P9-T1-S4

"The precision of line tracking was good and the pressing and releasing of the space bar has been done proficiently. The speed is low, but the accuracy is good. At the time of reaching the end corner, the sharpness of the movement is not enough, and the concentration of the participant is reduced.

"In the first part, the movement was on the line and uniform, but the speed was low. The inner corner of the star was passed sharply and on the line, but slight hand tremors were observed. The space bar was pressed early and released on time.",1,P24-T1-S1
"In the second part, the movement speed was low with slight deviations. The inner corner of the star was passed with a curve. The space bar was pressed and released early.",1,P24-T1-S2
"In the third part, the movement speed was low and uniform, staying on the line. The inner corner of the star was passed sharply and on the line. The space bar was not pressed correctly; it was pressed and released at an incorrect part of the path. The space bar was pressed and released at the wrong time at the required release point.",0,P24-T1-S3
"In the fourth part, the movement speed was low, uniform, and on the line. The inner corner of the star was passed with a slight curve. The space bar was pressed early and released on time.",1,P24-T1-S4
"In the fifth part, the movement speed was low, uniform, and on the line. The inner corner of the star was passed sharply and on the line. There was slight inward deviation at the end. The space bar was pressed early and released on time, but some strange movements were observed at the very end.",1,P24-T1-S5
"The timing of pressing the space bar was off, accompanied by minor inward deviation and a slower speed than expected.",1,P24-T2-S1
"A very minor outward deviation was noticed, but overall, there was a good following of the dashed line. However, there was an issue with anticipating the space bar too early, leading to pressing it too quickly.",1,P24-T2-S2
"A very minor inward deviation was observed, but overall, there was a good following of the dashed line. However, there was an issue with anticipating the space bar too early, leading to pressing it too quickly.",1,P24-T2-S3
"Similar to the previous subtrial, there was a very minor inward deviation, but overall, there was a good following of the dashed line. However, there was an issue with anticipating the space bar too early, leading to pressing it too quickly.",1,P24-T2-S4
"It mirrored the previous performance, with no deviation observed, yet there persisted an issue of anticipating the space bar too early, resulting in premature pressing.",1,P24-T2-S5
"The space bar was pressed and released prematurely, yet the movement remained precise overall, indicating good control despite the timing issue. The participant managed to maintain accuracy even with the premature action.",1,P24-T3-S1

"Maintained consistent early pressing and releasing of the space bar while maintaining precision, demonstrating strong control over the task. The participant effectively managed the section with consistent accuracy.",1,P24-T3-S5
The participant started correctly but showed a lot of deviations from the dashed line mostly outwards. Towards the end the pressed the space bar too early.,0,P24-T4-S1
The participant had some outward errors. They were almost consistant with the speed in this trial. They didn't press the space bar on time again. But they released it on time. ,1,P24-T4-S2
"In this section, the overall performance in terms of precision and speed was good, but the space bar handling sub task was not done correctly. The sharpness around the corner is not observed. ",1,P24-T4-S3
There is no problem in accuracy department. But the space bar is pressed way too early and released earlier than it should.,1,P24-T4-S4
The sharpness around the corner is not ovserved. The space bar is not handled well. The precision is acceptable. The average speed is good too. ,1,P24-T4-S5
The participant didn't follow the instructions and held the space bar from the start which is incorrect. In the first half there are large outward errors. Also the space bar handling is not fixed in the last part.So definitly room for improvement there. ,0,P24-T5-S1
Slight hand tremors as well as incorrect space bar handling was observed. The sharpness around the corner was good and overall average speed is acceptable. ,1,P24-T5-S2
The first half depicted a solid performance but in the second part inward errors which are more dangerous were observed. The space bar was pressed too early.,1,P24-T5-S3
This participant is realy accurate but lacks the focus to handle the space bar while maintaining accurate movement. ,1,P24-T5-S4
The speed is high and uniform. The precision is not bad. But the manouver around the corner is not sharp enough and there are some outward errors. The space bar was not handled on time. ,1,P24-T5-S5
